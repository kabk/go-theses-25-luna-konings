                <span class="firstletter">T</span><i>he wolf is back in the Netherlands! </i>But which wolf? Throughout history the wolf has taken on many forms: a thief, an unholy monk, a sexual predator, a tyrant, a racist caricature, a Nazi, an unwanted body of water and a symbol of the <i>other</i>. All these narratives have been crafted by human storytellers, projected onto an animal, often with underlying intentions. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real story of the wolf’s return, however, appears to be a complex accumulation of many different actors. The wolf, the sheep, the early agricultural human, the city dweller, the fence, the wildlife camera, Ursula von der Leyen’s pony, Little Red Riding Hood’s basket, they all have a special place in the intricate web of the story of the wolf. 
                This thesis explores how storytelling has shaped the wolf as a negative archetype, what the animal symbolizes in the Netherlands today, and how we might shift our perspective on nature through different ways of storytelling.

In the context of the debate about the wolf in The Netherlands, pro-wolf ideas are mainly picked up by leftist parties, whereas anti-wolf ideas usually roam in right winged parties.

              <span class="firstletter">I</span>n 2017, a young female wolf, born in East Germany and coded GW998f, travelled 600 
              kilometres west in search of new territory to form a pack. Unknowingly, she crossed into a land that had not seen a settled wolf in over 150 years. When her droppings were found on Dutch grounds in July 2018, national news declared it official: the wolf was back in the Netherlands. 
              <br> <br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after, a mate followed, and cubs were born. It was a romantic story that captivated the Dutch media. But the public sentiment quickly shifted when the first sheep fell victim to the newcomers’ appetite. Fascination turned into controversy, sparking a heated debate that continues to this day. Picked up by Dutch politics, the topic of the wolf became a culture war  in full blossom,<span class="footnotetext">1</span>  polarising city and farmland<span class="footnotetext">2</span> and reviving the age-old image of the <i>Big Bad Wolf</i>. 
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So-called "pro-wolf" advocates
              celebrate the return of the animal, seeing it as a sign of
              ecological restoration. They highlight the wolf’s role as a
              keystone species. On the
              other side stand the "anti-wolf" groups, who worry about the
              challenges of coexistence with an apex predator. For them, the
              wolf means a direct threat to the lives of domesticated animals
              such as sheep, ponies and dogs. And some even fear the safety of
              humans in a country shared with the wolf. 
            <br><br>
          
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many Western
              European children, I grew up encountering numerous wolves in
              bedtime stories like <i>The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats</i>, <i>Little
              Red Riding Hood</i> and <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>. Growing up in the Dutch
              city of The Hague, these tales of dark forests and lurking
              predators felt far away, yet their messages were clear: the wolf
              was dangerous, cunning, and cruel. Though fictional, these stories
              have shaped perceptions of wolves for centuries, and their
              influence persists today. 
            <br>
           
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this thesis, I move away from the
              opposing views on the wolf’s return to explore the fictional
              wolves that have long lived in our stories. In the first chapter,
              I examine the origins of the wolf’s villainous image and how these
              narratives continue to shape public discourse, often utilized by
              those who oppose the animal’s presence. In the second chapter, I
              explore how the wolf has acquired new symbolism in the modern age,
              challenging Dutch perceptions of nature and culture. Finally, I
              propose an alternative approach to storytelling, drawing on Ursula
              K. Le Guin’s <i>Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</i> and Donna Haraway’s
              <i>Staying with the Trouble</i> to imagine new narratives of coexistence
              with wolves. 
            <br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize the Dutch context of this
              research. As someone who grew up in the Netherlands with a deep
              love for nature, I have always struggled with the way nature is
              approached here. In this thesis, I explore this perspective by
              examining the stories and symbolism surrounding wolves. When I use
              “we” and “our”, I am specifically referring to the Dutch cultural
              context in which I was raised.

            <h3><br>1.1 History of Wolves and Humans—and Sheep</h3>
         
            <p class="Chapter1">
              <br>
              <span class="firstletter">I</span>n prehistoric times, wolves and humans coexisted without much conflict. It is even suggested that they benefited from each other’s presence. A group of wolves would stay close to a group of humans, scavenging their leftovers, while in return, the wolves provided warnings when danger from other animals or natural forces was near.<span class="footnotetext">6</span> This kind of relationship is not hard to imagine when considering dogs, the domesticated descendants of wolves, whom we still intertwine our lives with to this day.
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collaborative relationship began to fade only after we chose another animal to keep close to us: the sheep. As some of the first animals to be domesticated, sheep provided early agricultural societies with wool, meat, and milk—important provisions for  life at the time. While the sheep’s ancestors, mouflons, were quick and difficult to catch, we offered wolves a much slower, more abundant version—often fenced in—making them easy prey. The wolf might have seen this as a kind gesture on our part, and so, unknowingly, they took something we considered our own.<span class="footnotetext">7</span>  
              <br />
              <br />

            </p>
            <h3>1.2 The Big Bad Wolf</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              As the conflict with sheep-preying wolves made coexistence increasingly difficult, people in many European regions resorted to killing them. It wasn’t just the wolf’s population that declined severely during these hunts, but also its reputation. In Christian stories, sheep symbolized the faithful, Jesus was the shepherd, and the wolf became a metaphor for the devil. Other stories reinforced this view—Ysengrimus, the wolf who often appears in <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, was depicted as greedy and foolish, while the scary <i>Big Bad Wolf</i> lingered in children’s fairy tales like <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> and <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>“And they lived happily ever after”</i> is the familiar reassurance at the end of a thrilling fairy tale. But the line rarely applies to the wolves in these stories. Instead, they often suffer a horrid death that feels out of place in a cute bedtime tale. In <i>The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats</i>, Mama Goat cuts open the wolf’s belly, fills it with stones, and then lets him drown in the nearby river.<span class="footnotetext">8</span>In <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>, the piglets trap him in a pot, boil him alive, and eat him for supper.<span class="footnotetext">9</span>This suffering of fictional wolves mirrors the real life terrors that were inflicted on the species. 
              <br>
              <br>
            </p>
            

            <h3>1.3 A Human in Wolf's Clothing<br><br></h3>
            <p>
              The rise of these stories, resulting from human’s deteriorating relationship with wolves, created a lasting negative archetype of the animal. To this day, wolves suffer from this vilification through storytelling, with its demonized image helping to justify its extermination in areas where they are considered unwanted.
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s interesting, however, to look at the earliest stories in which wolves played the villain, as they don’t seem to be about wolves at all. Ysengrimus<span class="footnotetext">10</span>is a beast epic from 1148—a genre of animal tales satirizing human society, with animals playing human roles. In this epic, a foolish and greedy monk is portrayed as the wolf named Ysengrimus, yet the story says nothing about the animal itself.
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to one of the earliest versions of <i>Little Red Riding Hood,</i><span class="footnotetext">11</span> written in 1697 by Charles Perrault. The story unfolds much as we know it today, but after the young girl is eaten, Perrault adds a few lines to clarify the moral of his tale:
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>"Children, especially attractive, well-bred young ladies, should never talk to strangers, for if they do, they may well provide dinner for a wolf. I say ‘wolf,’ but there are various kinds of wolves. There are also those who are charming, quiet, polite, unassuming, complacent, and sweet, who pursue young women at home and in the streets. And unfortunately, it is these gentle wolves who are the most dangerous of all."</i>
              <br>
              <br>
              Again, the wolf is a stand-in for human dangers, chosen simply because it was a commonly hated and feared animal.
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other stories don’t explicitly base the wolf on humans but still contain clear parallels. In <i>The Wolf and the Lamb,</i><span class="footnotetext">12</span> which appeared in <i>Aesop’s Fables</i> probably around the 4th century BCE, a hungry wolf meets a lamb by the river. Inevitably, the wolf wants to eat the lamb, but since it looks so helpless, the wolf seeks an excuse to devour the innocent little creature. It blames the lamb for all sorts of things, which the lamb invariably proves to be impossible. No matter the refutations, the wolf loses its patience and feeds on the lamb. The fable ends with the moral:
              <br>
              <br>
              <i>"The tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny. 
              <br>
              The unjust will not listen to the reasoning of the innocent."</i>
              <br>
              <br>
              It’s not surprising that this fable was written by Aesop, an enslaved person in ancient Greece. It also strongly resembles how Western society treats the wolf, or any non-human life for that matter. An anthropocentric perspective leads us to believe that humans are superior to other forms of life and that nature can be instrumentalized to our own will. We think we are the dominators over nature, and thus, there are no consequences for our behaviour and injustices, as <i>the tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny.</i>  
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These stories about humans in wolves’ clothing reveal more about human nature than about nature itself. They served as cautionary tales—not about wolves, but about people. Still, these negative traits stuck to the wolf’s image, becoming engraved in our collective memory. Even after the very last wolf in the Netherlands was killed in 1868, fictional wolves continued to linger in our stories. In the absence of real wolves, the imaginary ones grew bigger and scarier, especially with the rise of animation. In 1933, Disney brought to life the well-known image of the <i>Big Bad Wolf</i>: an anthropomorphic, sly, drool-dripping, and skinny figure, always out to trick and kill innocent others.
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Disney’s first animated version of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>, the wolf disguises himself as a racist caricature of a Jewish door-to-door salesman, hoping to trick the piglets into letting him in. Just a few years later, in 1941, Disney reimagined the wolf as a Nazi in <i>The Thrifty Pig</i>. This shift highlights the paradoxes of the evil wolf character and how it serves as a blank slate onto which the storyteller projects their own convictions.
